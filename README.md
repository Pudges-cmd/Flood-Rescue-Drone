# Realtime-Human-Detection-With-YOLO11-with-SMS-Messaging
This is the code used in my Flood Rescue Drone Project, very rudimentary I know. It uses YOLO11 to detect humans then if there is detected it sends an SMS. This is all meant for a Raspberry Pi with a Waveshare 7600G-H Hat for the messaging. The SMS will include stuff like GPS Location etc.
